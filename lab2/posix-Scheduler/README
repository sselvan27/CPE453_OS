Quarter: Spring 2019
Assignment: Lab 2

Completing this project will require writing the following C files:

schedule_fcfs.c
schedule_sjf.c
schedule_rr.c
schedule_priority.c
schedule_priority_rr.c

The supporting files invoke the appropriate scheduling algorithm. 

For example, to build the scheduler, enter

make fcfs
make sjf
make rr
make priority
make priority_rr

which builds the executable file.

Testing: ./[executable] schedule.txt
